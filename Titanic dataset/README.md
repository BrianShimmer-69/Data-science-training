Titanic dataset evaluation summary

The models that I worked on both logistic regression and random forest classifier had good results which show that the predictability of this dataset and the reliability of the models are good. 
Result evaluation:

Models predict survival rate  with 81-82 % accuracy, which is a good prediction level .
Their precision and recall in logistic regression has a small difference but overall the results are reliable with 77 % as the bench mark for both the models
Confusion matrix for Random forest model shows more favourable predictions compared to logistic regression giving random forest classifier a clear edge. 
Random forest observes non linear interactions between features better compared to logistic regression.
